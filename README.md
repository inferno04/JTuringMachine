JTuringMachine
==============

A Rudimentary Turing Machine implementation in Java.

NOTE:
	Some liberties have been taken regarding the "original" specification of a Turing machine.
	The included source files operate under the assumption that in addition to L and R, the machine my H (or HOLD) without moving the read-write head.

Created after Computational Models (Millersville University CS 340) lecture, as a proof-of-concept.
